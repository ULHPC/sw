# 2019b User Software Set Release

All **production** releases **SHOULD** be operated as `resif`, and source `settings/prod/<version>/<cluster>[...].sh`
A dedicated set of launcher scripts were setup under `scripts/prod/launcher-*`

**`/!\ IMPORTANT:`** **ONLY launch production build as resif ONCE validated under `/work/projects/sw` with the "regular" launchers under your user name**.

2019b ULHPC software set is produced by

```
./scripts/prod/launcher-resif-prod-build-{cpu,cpu-skylake,gpu}.sh -v 2019b [...]
```

Below are a recap of the installation notes of the 2019b software set.

```bash
$> ssh resif@{iris|aion}-cluster
$> cd git/gitlab.uni.lu/ULHPC/sw
$> screen -S 2019b
